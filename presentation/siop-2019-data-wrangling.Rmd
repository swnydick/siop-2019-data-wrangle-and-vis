```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 4, fig.height = 3)
```

## Package Installation

This demonstration requires the following packages:

- magrittr
- openxlsx
- reshape2
- dplyr
- ggplot2
- ggthemes
- roperators

You can install them with (modifying) the following line of code

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("magrittr")
```

## Ground Rules

1. This session assumes little familiarity with `R`. Please ask questions about
   anything. We have used `R` for a very long time and sometimes forget what
   we had to learn.
2. Try to run all of the code in `RStudio`. The setup of the demonstrations
   naturally works in `RStudio`. If you do not have `RStudio`, you can certainly
   run all of the code in `R` or a different IDE.
4. Have fun!

## Overview of `R`

- `R` was written by statisticians

    - Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman
    - Many of the base packages in `R`, such as "class", "cluster",
      "KernSmooth", "MASS", "nlme", "nnet", "rpart", "spatial", "stats",
      and "survival", are for statistical computation.
    - A base object (a `data.frame`) is for the organization of datasets for
      statistical analysis.

- `R` is Open Source

    - Anybody can download the code for their own purposes.
    - Anybody can modify the code on their own computer.

## Overview of `R` (cont.)

- `R` is a functional, object-flavored programming language.

    - "Functional" means everything in `R` is a function.

    ```{r}
    # one way
    x    <- c(1, 2, 3)
    x[2] <- 4
    x
    
    # another way
    y    <- c(1, 2, 3)
    y    <- "[<-"(y, 2, 4)
    y
    ```
 
   - Even `<-` is a function (the `<-` function) and `function` is a function
     (the `function` function ... clearly).
   
## Overview of `R` (cont.)

- `R` is a functional, object-flavored language.

    - Object-flavored means that `R` contains objects and different operations
      depend on the object.
      
    ```{r}
    df  <- mtcars        # a data.frame
    mod <- lm(mpg ~ cyl, # a linear model
              data = df)
    
    summary(df[1:4])
    summary(mod)
    ```


## Basic `R` Functions: Assignment

To attach variables to objects, use the `<-` or `=` operators.

```{r, message=FALSE}
require(roperators)
x    <- 2
y    <- TRUE
g    <- "a"
h     = 3
blah <- x + h
cat("x = " %+% x, "y = " %+% y, "g = " %+% g, "h = " %+% h, "blah = " %+% blah,
    sep = "  |  ")
```

The `<-` is preferred by convention.

## Basic `R` Functions: Vectors

Ordinary vectors can be created by the `c` (concatenate) function.

```{r}
x <- c(2, 3)
y <- c(5, 6)
z <- c(x, y)
z
```

You can also generate "systematic" vectors.

```{r}
1:10
seq(from = 1, to = 3, by = .5)
rep(1, times = 10)
```

## Basic `R` Functions: Vectors

Functions in `R` are often "vectorized" (which helps with readability)

```{r}
x <- 1:10
y <- 11:20
x + y
```

Compare that with `python`

```{python, engine.path = '/usr/local/bin/python3'}
x = range(1, 11)
y = range(11, 21)
print(list(map(lambda i, j: i + j, x, y)))
```

Ignore the specifics. There are other ways of doing this in `python`, but it's
certainly not as easy or clean as `R`.

## Basic `R` Functions: Data Frames

Data frames are the typical unit of storage with the typical use case:

1. Take a bunch of vectors all of the same length.

    - Each vector must be a single "mode" (logical, numeric, character)
    - Different vectors can be different "modes"
    
2. Bind them together.

```{r, message=FALSE}
require(dplyr)
df <- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = letters[1:10], z = rep(TRUE, 10),
                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
glimpse(df)
```

## Basic `R` Functions: Piping

- Piping is a new "method" that is compatible with `dplyr` functions.

    - The most common pipe is `%>%`.
    - When you see a pipe, think "and then".
    - Piping lets us construct a chain where the output of one function is the
      input to the next.
      
- There are many tutorials on piping in `R`.

    - https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pipe-r-tutorial
    - https://uc-r.github.io/pipe
    - https://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html

## Basic `R` Functions: Piping (cont.)

Here is an example of when piping might help...
      
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(magrittr)
# without piping (parse inner to outer)
round(exp(diff(pnorm(rnorm(10)))), 1)

# with piping (parse top to bottom)
rnorm(10) %>%
  pnorm() %>%
  diff()  %>%
  exp()   %>%
  round(1)
```

Notice how piping makes it easier to see what's happening (like a recipe):

1. First, take 10 random deviates from a standard normal distribution
2. (Then) find the percentile of that distribution
3. (Then) take the difference between successive elements ...
