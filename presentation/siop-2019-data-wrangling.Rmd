## Package Installation

This demonstration requires the following packages:

- magrittr
- openxlsx
- reshape2
- dplyr
- ggplot2
- ggthemes
- roperators

You can install them with (modifying) the following line of code

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("magrittr")
```

## What we want from you:

1. This session assumes little familiarity with `R`. Please ask questions about
   anything. We have used `R` for a very long time and sometimes forget what
   we had to learn.
2. Try to run all of the code in `RStudio`. The setup of the demonstrations
   naturally works in `RStudio`. If you do not have `RStudio`, you can certainly
   run all of the code in `R` or a different IDE.
4. Have fun!

## Overview of `R`

- `R` is a functional, object-flavored programming language.

    - "Functional" means everything in `R` is a function. Everything from
      concatenation, to addition, to assignment, to extraction, to replacing
      is a function under-the-hood.

    ```{r}
    # nearly everything here is a function call ...
    x    <- c(1, 2, 3)
    x[2] <- 4
    x
    ```


## Basic `R` Functions: Assignment

To attach variables to objects, use the `<-` or `=` operators. `<-` is preferred
by convention.

```{r, message=FALSE}
require(roperators)
x    <- 2
y    <- TRUE
g    <- "a"
h     = "\U0001f620" # = is Frowned upon >:(
blah <- x + y

cat("x = " %+% x, "y = " %+% y, "g = " %+% g, "h was made with = " %+% h, "blah = " %+% blah,
    sep = "  |  ")
```


## Basic `R` Functions: Vectors

Ordinary vectors can be created by the `c` (concatenate/combine) function. There
are other ways of creating vectors, including `:` and `seq` for sequences.

```{r}
x <- c(2, 3)
y <- c(5, 6)
z <- c(x, y)
z
```

## Basic `R` Functions: Vectors (cont.)

Functions in `R` are often "vectorized" (which helps with readability). Note
that `1:10` creates a sequence and can be read `1-to-10`.

```{r}
x <- 1:10  # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
y <- 11:20 # 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20
x + y
```

Compare that with `python`

```{python, engine.path = '/usr/local/bin/python3'}
x = range(1, 11)
y = range(11, 21)
print(list(map(lambda i, j: i + j, x, y)))
```

Ignore the specifics. There are other ways of doing this in `python`, but it's
certainly not as easy or clean as `R`.

## Basic `R` Functions: Data Frames

Data frames are the typical unit of storage with the typical use case:

1. Take a bunch of vectors all of the same length.

    - Each vector must be a single `mode` (`logical`, `numeric`, `character`)
    - Different vectors can be different `mode`s
    
2. Bind them together.

```{r, message=FALSE}
require(dplyr)
df <- data.frame(x = 1:10,
                 y = letters[1:10],
                 z = rep(TRUE, 10),
                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
glimpse(df)
```

## Basic `R` Functions: Piping

- Piping is a new "method" that is compatible with `dplyr` functions.

    - The most common pipe is `%>%`.
    - When you see a pipe, think "THEN".
    - Piping lets us construct a chain where the output of one function is the
      input to the next.
      
- There are many tutorials on piping in `R`.

    - https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pipe-r-tutorial
    - https://uc-r.github.io/pipe
    - https://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html

## Basic `R` Functions: Piping (cont.)

Here is an example of when piping might help...
      
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(magrittr)
# without piping (parse inner to outer)
round(diff(pnorm(rnorm(10))), 1)

# with piping (parse top to bottom)
rnorm(10) %>%
  pnorm() %>%
  diff()  %>%
  round(1)
```

Notice how piping makes it easier to see what's happening (like a recipe):

1. First, take 10 random deviates from a standard normal distribution
2. (Then) find the percentile of that distribution
3. (Then) take the difference between successive elements
4. (Then) round to 1 decimal place
